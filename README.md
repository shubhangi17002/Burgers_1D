Solve the 1D random forced viscous Burgers equation with high order finite element and finite difference methods.

The main driver of the code is the file Main.m

The implemented finite element methods are:
  * linear Lagrange element
  * cubic Lagrange element
  * cubic Hermite element
  * 5th order Hermite element
  
The energy spectrum is computed and compared with a reference spectrum from a pseudo-spectral code.
